# How to Use

1. Clone this repository at your home directory
2. Use `stow <directory-name>` to use the dotfiles.

> [!NOTE]
> For `tmux` directory, after running `stow tmux`, you have to install TPM first using `git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.config/tmux/plugins/tpm` command. After that, type `tmux` in your terminal and press `Ctrl+b Ctrl+I` to install the tmux plugins. If you're new to this, it means that you have to press `Ctrl`, then press `b`, then press `I` without releasing the `Ctrl` key.
